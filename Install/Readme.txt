Inventory Filter version 1.6.2 by Mr.STALIN 

The plugin is fully functional with the versions of sfall v4.2.2+ with earlier versions may be some mistakes in his work.

CAUTION: For the filter script to work correctly, required to enable the AllowUnsafeScripting option in the ddraw.ini file (enabled automatically during installation).

To useful things of the category "Misc", for display added some items from the Olympus2207 and Fallout 2: Nevada. (from Foxx)
Added Smart Barter mode - allowing the player during trading to not take care of money after the termination of the barter deal.
Added a panel for convenient switching between party members during trade or exchange with the car.
The new "Drop All" button is available only for sfall v4.1.0+ with the InterfaceDontMoveOnTop option enabled.
Assign hot keys to switching between filtering modes (for sfall v4.2+).
