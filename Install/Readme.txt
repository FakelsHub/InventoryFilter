ATTENTION: For the filter to work correctly, you need to enable the AllowUnsafeScripting option in the ddraw.ini configuration file (enabled automatically when installed).

Additional features:
Smart Barter Mode - allows the player to not worry about money at the end of a barter transaction during trading. 
Swap mode - allows you to conveniently switch between party members during trading or exchange with containers/car trunk.
Adds a "Drop all" button for the exchange interface with containers and party members.
